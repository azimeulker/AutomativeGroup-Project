## Functionality
The AutomotiveGroup project includes several features, including:
<ul>
<li>Sales Quote: when the user puts in the vehicle sales price, trade-in amount, and chooses accessories and exterior finish options, the program will calculate a summary and finance options. Additionally, the program can generate a car wash invoice if the user chooses a package and fragrance.</li>
<li>Car Wash Form: when the user chooses a package and fragrance they wish for, the program will calculate the subtotal and total cost. An invoice is also generated and available for the user to view after the calculation.</li>
<li>Vehicle Data Form: the user can see the vehicle data form and delete data as needed</li>
<li>About Dialog Box: provides additional information about the project and its creators.</li>
